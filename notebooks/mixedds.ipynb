       " 'a litter of kittens had been born about two weeks earlier and were playing in the hay . victoria and the children huddled around them , enjoying the small creatures and petting their soft fur . they spent the rest of the morning just playing with the kittens and finding food for them , not leaving until all six of them settled down and fell asleep on top of one another . the three of them trotted happily back to the palace and victoria decided to take the children to the kitchens for lunch . there was no need for a servant to bring them something when they could just as easily , and more happily , make something for themselves .\\n',\n",
       " \"then the anger rushed back and she could n't stop herself from asking , `` where do you think i 've been ?

       " \"she was about to shut her mouth but the furious look in his eyes and the muscle twitching on his jaw told her she might have gone too far . `` we went to the stables and played with the kittens . you probably did n't see us because you 're nose is too high in the air or maybe because you 're mind is relentlessly in the gutter . and then , '' she went on when she saw that he was going to say something , `` we went to the kitchen and made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches ourselves . after that , we went to the portrait gallery and looked at the picture of your brother .\\n\",\n",
       " \"she would n't go down that path again . it hurt too much when her hopes were dashed cruelly under his unfeeling manners . `` i wo n't leave until the children transfer their trust to you , '' she said and walked away . victoria headed back to her room and noticed that her clothes were all put away as was her suitcase . her bed was made as well and all evidence of the previous night was gone .\\n\",\n",
       " \"her eyes were closed but she could see the lights from the ceiling through her eyelids and she just gloried in the feel of the music and being alone . suddenly , she felt strong arms encircle her waist . she tensed instantly , even though she knew it was n't a stranger . it was dharr . she 'd know his scent anywhere .\\n\",\n",
       " \"`` i 'm sorry . i did n't realize i 'd hurt you so much last night . it was never my intention . '' victoria found the strength and swung around . he would n't let her move away but at least she was facing him now .\\n\",\n",

       " \"what did you order ?

       " \"pulling the satin coverlet over her now shivering body , she rolled over and closed her eyes , hoping to rid herself of the memory of kadar 's kiss through sleep . despite what he assumed about her sexual prowess with men , she had actually lived a very sheltered life . she 'd run away from home partly because she did n't want to see kasar flirting , and possibly more , with the other women he brought to the palace and partly because she did n't want to marry him and have the same kind of marriage her parents had . her parents fought . she knew they loved but their fights were loud and uncompromising .\\n\",\n",

       " \"`` i thought you knew everything , '' sarila laughed , delighted with the idea of being within the security of her parents ' arms again . she 'd forgotten how nice it was to be around her mother 's worrying and her father 's arrogance . `` it is n't like hearing it from you . now talk , '' she said sitting down next to her daughter and placing her chin on the open palm of her hand , completely ignoring her own plate of food , preferring to keep her eyes on her daughter . they spent several hours talking and catching up with each other .\\n\",\n",
       " \"i was sent to do your hair if you need assistance , '' a petite , round woman said , speaking in arabic . sarila considered the option for all of five seconds before accepting . she had n't had someone to do her hair since she 'd left the palace so many years ago and she 'd forgotten the little luxuries palace life afforded her . `` oh , that would be lovely , '' sarila said and stepped back to let the woman into the room . the woman stepped back out of the room and then back in , this time carrying a large case that looked something like a tool chest .\\n\",\n",

'' rocco could n't believe that and turned around , still expecting to see her come out of the bathroom , looking shy and delectable . `` where is she ? '' he asked , his voice getting deeper as his anger increased .\\n\",\n",
       " \"the woman he 'd started to think of as different was only playing a game . a more advanced game , he gathered . he thought about not playing , about not giving in to whatever demands she might give him for their next liaison . but the thought of not holding her body again had him gritting his teeth with frustration . `` i 'll be right there , '' he said and slammed the door , his fury rising as he tried to figure out her game .\\n\",\n",
       " \"stu asked the question to the guard and shook his head . `` she walked , sir . '' rocco could n't believe that . she 'd been wearing those ridiculous heels and she 'd barely been able to walk by the time he 'd brought her inside . `` impossible ! ''\\n\",\n",
       " \"`` take me there , '' rocco snapped , already showered and dressed in a business suit even though the horizon still had n't started lightening to indicate the morning had begun its timid presence on the day . twenty minutes later , he was still furious as he stood outside her apartment knocking . she was n't answering her door , but nor was there any noise inside . she must have gone into work which is exactly what he should be doing . he paced the hallway for several moments , considering his next move .\\n\",\n",
       " \"so he 'd revised his opinion , only to have that blown away as well . by the time he was leaving his office , his anger was at a boiling point . there had been no word from the woman and stu had n't come back with his normal file on her either . so he was working this situation blind and trying hard not to assume anything further . so far , all of his assumptions had been wrong and the only thing left was that she was a sweet , kind woman with a generous spirit and a body a man would gladly die to possess .\\n\",\n",
       " \"normally those kinds of machinations irritated him , but in this case , he wanted brianna so badly , he would gladly drape her in any designer dress she prettily begged for . then he stopped himself , irritated beyond reason for the way his mind was being controlled by his lust for a slender , innocent looking woman . all the games had been tried on him and he was n't going to fall for this one either . he wanted her to be honest with her desires and if she could n't play by his rules , he wanted to have nothing to do with her . but by the end of the evening , when he was leaving the ball after only being there for an hour , he was still furious , but now his anger had turned to concern .\\n\",\n",
       " \"none had brianna 's sweet smile or her shy glances that turned him on so much . and none had that crazy , honest response when he kissed her . of course , he had n't bothered to kiss any of the women on display tonight , but he did n't have to kiss them to know . it was just a gut feeling that none of the women tonight would have had the same impact . and rocco was never one to settle for less than the best .\\n\",\n",

       " \"she e-mailed the picture to nikki with the subject , `` any ideas on what this is ? '' her cell phone camera had not only captured words , but also an emblem on the upper left hand corner . the letters underneath were foreign and she could n't remember where , but she 'd seen that emblem somewhere . it was important , of that she was sure . but she could n't figure out what was going on .\\n\",\n",
       " \"she said and turned back to her computer . how had she let the time slip away from her ? she could n't believe that she 'd just been thinking about how she never missed a deadline and here she was , idling stupidly while her deadline came and went . `` i 'm on it , '' she replied in a horrified rush . when the gentle hand on her shoulder stopped her , she sighed and turned back to her editor .\\n\",\n",
       " \"`` brianna , what 's going on ? you 've been jumpy and out of sorts today . definitely not like yourself . '' she blushed and looked away , not willing to tell this kind but often brusque man what she 'd done last night . she could n't even say it was in pursuit of a story because she had n't thought about the story or the investigation after walking up that staircase with rocco .\\n\",\n",
       " \"there were even guards strolling around the perimeter of the house ! so she 'd thought that it might be easier to sneak in while the guests were leaving . mentally , she 'd argued that security would be more lax when there were n't so many people trying to get in . but no one was leaving ! she had no idea how long these fancy parties lasted , but she refused to look at her watch again .\\n\",\n",
       " \"rocco 's startled eyes looked down at stu 's . they both knew what was at stake here . `` you do n't think she found out ... '' stu 's face looked blank . `` i ca n't be sure . you met her at tombe coeur .\\n\",\n",
